                    it comes to writing, he remains ambiguous about sounds and words. His mind perceives words in a manner- mostly chaotic, imprecise and dancing as he describes it in the movie, that he cannot read them. This difficulty occurs due to
                    dyslexia which the teacher, the school, his own parents, and the society as a whole did not consider or at the least, tried to ignore it by just blaming him for the way he was.</p>

                    dyslexia. It can be considered under ‘Cognitive Disabilities’ which refers to the brain’s inability to store, and process information. It involves impairments in attention, orientation, memory, problem-solving and judgment,
                    information processing such as reading, writing, and behaviour</p>

                  <p class="p2">It is significant to note here that children with disability and children with special needs are two different terms. The term children with special needs indicate the individual requirements (as for education) of a person with a
                    deprived background or a mental, emotional, or physical impairment or a high risk of developing one. In this study, it is more appropriate to address Ishaan as a child with special needs rather disability. This is because, from
                    the beginning, we see that Ishaan has a taste for nature. He is a good artist and excels at paintings. Those paintings of his have confident brush strokes, bold use of colours as his art teacher describes in the film. He makes a
                    unique flipbook that incarnates the story of his separation from his family. As Ram Shankar Nikumbh, his art teacher played by Amir Khan says, “Such creativity, from a child who is barely eight- year- old. Sir, very few of us
                    think out of the box.” (02:02:20-02:02:22). The crucial point to focus on is that ‘learning disability’ is not an issue with intellect, talent or ability. Children with learning disabilities are smart and active as any normal
                    child, but the only difference is that their brain is wired differently and their brain lags in processing the information. This is exactly why it would be unfair to call him a disabled child as he is talented and capable, but
                    just needs assistance to overcome the lag and keep up the pace to fit in the normative society</p>

                  <p class="p2">Though deficiency is a part of his daily experience but he is generally disabled by the society. He faces biased social attitude as his own parents compare him with his friends and brother, injustice with respect to sending him
                    to boarding school as a punishment and also he does not get access to resources. Not only children with special needs face this trauma but they who care for them and fight for their inclusion and equality in society also face it.
                    In the film, Ishaan’s mother undergoes that trauma as well more than anybody else. He is disabled in the society, in his home, in his school because of the stigma that gets attached to him as a poor learner and so he was punished
                    all the time. A stigma is a trait that one possesses which causes one to lose prestige in the eyes of the others. Goffman believed that a stigma can cause an individual to have a spoiled identity just like how Ishaan had.
                    According to Goffman, stigma is a “mark of difference that makes one undesired in a particular social setting” (156). And Brown notes how stigma hinders a person from access to social power in his work Stigma: An Engima
                    Demystified.Apart from the stigma, the education system in India also acts as a barrier for children with dyslexia and other impairments. In the film, the principal of the boarding school suggests that there are other schools specially made and functioned for children with similar problems. But Ishaan’s art teacher argues by affirming that the education act of India suggests that every child has the right to get education equally without any discrepancy. The very idea of the society to not have schools inclusive of children of every kind and to marginalize them by not creating a friendly environment where they are also a part of it, by separating them from the normativity and creating isolated spaces for them to grow makes them disabled, as they do not get access to society and resources as any other normal able-bodied person or a child is likely to get. This is how the social model works where the society is less equipped to create an equal space for all kinds of children especially those who have impairments.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Such experimental films which not only entertain but also teach is very important in building an inclusive society. After the release of the movie, the Central Board of Secondary Education issued a circular allowing students with disabilities extra compensatory time to complete their exams (Mahaseth, 2019). Such awareness is important as there is an urgent need for the world to become more sensitive. As Thomson talks about the relationship between the disabled and non-disabled people in a society, he explains how we do not respond to the world directly but we place social and symbolic meanings on them. There can be a change in the world and in the social model of disability when we try and change those overruled symbolic and social meanings that are attached to people with impairments.</p>
