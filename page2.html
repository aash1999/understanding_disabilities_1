                  <p>Ishaan is a student of 3rd standard. He is poor in his studies, is unable to read and write properly but he is very good at art. He gets confused among alphabets and numbers. He can talk and express his emotion verbally but when
                    it comes to writing, he remains ambiguous about sounds and words. His mind perceives words in a manner- mostly chaotic, imprecise and dancing as he describes it in the movie, that he cannot read them. This difficulty occurs due to
                    dyslexia which the teacher, the school, his own parents, and the society as a whole did not consider or at the least, tried to ignore it by just blaming him for the way he was.</p>

                  <p>It is significant to note here that children with disability and children with special needs are two different terms. The term children with special needs indicate the individual requirements (as for education) of a person with a
                    deprived background or a mental, emotional, or physical impairment or a high risk of developing one. In this study, it is more appropriate to address Ishaan as a child with special needs rather disability. This is because, from
                    the beginning, we see that Ishaan has a taste for nature. He is a good artist and excels at paintings. Those paintings of his have confident brush strokes, bold use of colours as his art teacher describes in the film. He makes a
                    unique flipbook that incarnates the story of his separation from his family. As Ram Shankar Nikumbh, his art teacher played by Amir Khan says, “Such creativity, from a child who is barely eight- year- old. Sir, very few of us
                    think out of the box.” (02:02:20-02:02:22). The crucial point to focus on is that ‘learning disability’ is not an issue with intellect, talent or ability. Children with learning disabilities are smart and active as any normal
                    child, but the only difference is that their brain is wired differently and their brain lags in processing the information. This is exactly why it would be unfair to call him a disabled child as he is talented and capable, but
                    just needs assistance to overcome the lag and keep up the pace to fit in the normative society</p>

                  <p>Dyslexia is a type of learning disability that affects a person’s reading and writing. It is due to a defect in the brain’s ability to process graphics and symbols. Perplexity and equivocality can well describe the problem of
                    dyslexia. It can be considered under ‘Cognitive Disabilities’ which refers to the brain’s inability to store, and process information. It involves impairments in attention, orientation, memory, problem-solving and judgment,
                    information processing such as reading, writing, and behaviour</p>

                  <p>Though deficiency is a part of his daily experience but he is generally disabled by the society. He faces biased social attitude as his own parents compare him with his friends and brother, injustice with respect to sending him
                    to boarding school as a punishment and also he does not get access to resources. Not only children with special needs face this trauma but they who care for them and fight for their inclusion and equality in society also face it.
                    In the film, Ishaan’s mother undergoes that trauma as well more than anybody else. He is disabled in the society, in his home, in his school because of the stigma that gets attached to him as a poor learner and so he was punished
                    all the time. A stigma is a trait that one possesses which causes one to lose prestige in the eyes of the others. Goffman believed that a stigma can cause an individual to have a spoiled identity just like how Ishaan had.
                    According to Goffman, stigma is a “mark of difference that makes one undesired in a particular social setting” (156). And Brown notes how stigma hinders a person from access to social power in his work Stigma: An Engima
                    Demystified. (add the social model a bit, also talk about how the society is less equipped to help children with dyslexia)</p>
